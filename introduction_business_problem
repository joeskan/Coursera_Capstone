Recently, coffee shops have maintained a consistent status of popularity, especially near more urbanized areas. 
A significant portion of the customer base is consisted of young adults, particularly university students. 
It's no wonder why many coffee shops are located in close proximity to a college/university. 
Such stores offer a relatively quiet place to study as well as an easy source of pastries, desserts, and coffee. 
However, not many such stores are run  late into the night, when the students might need them the most. 
Thus, I wish to look at which location in a college town, such as Austin, Texas, might be the most optimal place to open a coffee shop and compare data for other places to study that students might frequent.
